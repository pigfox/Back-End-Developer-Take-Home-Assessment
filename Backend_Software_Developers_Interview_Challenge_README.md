Please don't hesitate to contact your interviewer if you have any questions or feedback about the test. We're looking for cleverness and attention to detail, not how quickly you can get it done.

Please use whichever language you're comfortable with (unless the position you applied to had a specfic language/technology specification). As a developer, you're expected to have worked with a plethora of different programming languages, so represent yourself with your strongest language choice. As long as you can provide instructions on how to execute it so we can see the results, it's fine with us.
